If you already installed [HostFixes](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/CharlesE2/HostFixes), you can safely ignored this mod, this mod only made for standalone backup.

## Background

Why i made this mod? hmm i have following reasons:
1. For PVP players, i only respect the player who like to play with fair;
2. For PVE players, sometimes you might encounter random players who really unwelcome;
3. This mod disable PVP in Ship, won't fully disable PVP in the game by default;
4. I do think this is a necessary protection if play with random players.
